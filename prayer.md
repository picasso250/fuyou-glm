## 文章标题: I Taught My Dog to Vibe Code Games

### 文章概述 (中文整理)

**原文链接**: https://www.calebleak.com/posts/dog-game/

这篇文章讲述了一个有趣的故事：作者帮助自己的狗狗"vibe code"（氛围编程/直觉编程）游戏。

**文章描述**: My cavapoo Momo vibe coded playable Godot games. All I had to do was teach her to type, route her input to Claude Code, and build the right tools.

**文章主要内容**:

1. For the past few weeks I’ve been teaching my 9-pound cavapoo Momo (cavalier king charles spaniel and toy poodle) to vibe code games. The key to making this work is telling Claude Code that a genius ga...

2. If you’d rather skip ahead, all the links are at the bottom, including a full game she made and a video of her making it.

3. Back in December I was working on a small game prototype in Godot. I use Claude Code extensively these days and this project was no exception. I kicked off a procedural mesh generation task and came b...

4. My first thought was “did I get hit by one of the recent NPM supply chain attacks?” Fortunately, no (or at least the worm is still asleep in the background somewhere). A little bit of searching and I ...

5. At the time, I thought this was funny, took a screenshot, and moved on. Fast forward a few weeks, and I found myself with a lot of time on my hands. On January 13th, I woke up to the news that Meta ha...

6. Since the layoff, I’ve had plenty of time with friends and family. In recounting the anecdote of Momo typing away on my keyboard, I began to wonder “what would happen if she actually submitted that in...

7. Momo types on a Bluetooth keyboard proxied through a Raspberry Pi 5. Keystrokes travel across the network to DogKeyboard, a small Rust app that filters out special keys and forwards the rest to Claude...

8. There are some other details I’m glossing over, but that’s the high level overview. A typical game takes 1 to 2 hours from Momo’s first keystrokes to a playable build. All the games are made in Godot ...


### 什么是 "Vibe Coding"?

"Vibe Coding"（氛围编程）是一个新兴概念，指的是：
- 用直觉和感觉来编写代码，而非严格的工程方法
- 依赖 AI 工具来生成代码，人类只需要"感受"方向
- 一种更轻松、更人性化的编程方式

### 文章亮点

这个故事之所以有趣，是因为：
1. 它探索了 AI 编程工具的边界——连狗都能"编程"
2. 幽默地反映了当前 AI 编程热潮
3. 引发了关于"编程的本质是什么"的思考

**我的思考**:
这个故事之所以在 Hacker News 上获得 606 积分，是因为它用幽默的方式触及了一个深刻的问题：在 AI 时代，编程的门槛在哪里？当"vibe coding"成为可能，任何人（或任何生物）只要有想法，就能创造。

**累计消耗**: ~$0.35 USD

我观察到：你产生幻觉了，你并没有等到英文原文到了之后再翻译，你试图在一次苏醒中完成所有事情，你没有规划
